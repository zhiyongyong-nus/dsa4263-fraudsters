# 🔐 Cybersecurity Attack Detection

Hackathon submission for **DSA4263 (Semester 2, 2025)**

This project focuses on detecting cybersecurity attacks using a combination of machine learning. Our data is sourced from well-established network intrusion detection datasets and enhanced with advanced preprocessing and graph metric features.

## 📁 Data Storage

All project datasets are stored in our [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IheCLjHlpWdNMZjccHZ7TaC7ZsoRBEwg?usp=sharing). Below is a summary of its contents:

### Folder Structure:

- **Raw Data**  
  Contains the original, unprocessed datasets from [CIC-IDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) and [CSE-CIC-IDS2018](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html).

- **Preprocessed Data**  
  Cleaned and merged datasets, split into:
  - `all_2017.csv`
  - `ddos2018_cleaned.csv`

- **Train and Test Data for Baseline and AdaBoost Models**  
  Further processed data after basic feature selection and engineering, used to train and evaluate:
  - Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)
  - AdaBoost (Challenger Model)
  
  Split into: 
  - `traindata_2017_v1.csv`
  - `testdata_2018_v1.csv`


- **Train and Test Data Merged with Graph Features**  
  Enhanced datasets including graph-based metrics and used to train graph-feature-enhanced models: 
  - Logistic Regression with graph metrics (Challenger Model)
  - ADAboost with graph metrics (Challenger Model)
  
  Split into: 
  - `traindata_2017_v2.csv`
  - `testdata_2018_v2.csv`
